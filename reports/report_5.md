## Individual Contributions

### Previous Week Goals:

**Oliver** - Get the login page backend set up and look into email verification.

**Henry** - Will work on the fixing the bug where the tabs are not highlighted/bold when on that route.

**Thao** - Fix bugs, work on implementation, write user manual and developer guidelines in the projectâ€™s Git Repository.

**Celestine** -  Solve the class card overflow problem. Refactor our file organization for better modularity (separate our Homepage.tsx and all tests). Start implementation of course pages linked to the directory cards.

**Jeremy** - Investigate the data where there are some classes that have wrong description/wrong classes in the database. Also try to help Oliver fix his Vercel environment. Potentially look into finding an easier way to view backend changes with Vercel instead of deploying each time/waiting for deployment.

### Progress and Issues:

**Oliver** - Added database insertion of creating user accounts and database read of logging user accounts.

**Henry** - Fixed the default route test issue, cleaned up Figma design, and added a description box to describe what the rating categories are. Also worked on fixing the tabs not remaining bold when clicked on.

**Thao** - Reviewed pull requests, created user manual and bug report template for the repository.

**Celestine** - Helped get Developer Guide to repository. Reviewed pull requests.

**Jeremy** - Got the data fixed and updated the table with appropriate names. Seems that Oliver has his environment set up for Vercel.

### Next Week Goals:

**Oliver** - Set up email verification and add password hiding feature when typing passwords.

**Henry** - Will fix the tabs not remaining bold issue.

**Thao** - Set up course page routing.

**Celestine** - Refactor the codebase so that components exist in separate folders. Help Thao set up the course page routing.

**Jeremy** - Get temporary/read-only permissions for our database. Look into the AWS service that does email storage/verification for Oliver. Will also check that the changes to the database do not break the query to list all classes.
