# Report 1 (Week 4) due 10/18/23

## Team Report

### Previous Week Goals
N/A

### Progress and Issues

- Completed requirements document
- Set up online "daily standup" requirement for communication
- Set up our group Git repository
- Set up React app in repositiory to run on GitHub Pages
- Began work on UI design of the main directory

We had to communicate most intensively on the requirements, and spent a lot of time discussing our approach and clarifying our vision. We had some trouble keeping each other updated and responding promptly regarding our responsibilities on the document, and some team members came across as unresponsive regarding feedback on days where we did not meet in person. As a result, we implemented a “daily standup” channel in our Discord server that requires group members to check in on progress, plans, and blocks on non-meeting days so that we can hold each other accountable.

The later tasks were able to be completed by the individuals assigned to them fairly independently, which was good for our efficiency.

We are currently blocked on the completion of the UI design, as we need it to be able to move forward implementing the pages in React.

### Next Week Goals

- Complete Milestone planned for 10/24/23
    - Finish UI design for all major features/pages
    - Set up environment (staging branch, database)
- Begin Milestone planned for 10/27/24
    - Start React implementation of homepage
- Complete Design and Architecture documentation due 10/24/23
