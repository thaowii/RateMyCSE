# RateMyCSE
RateMyCSE is a website for UW students to rate, review, and better understand the structure of CSE classes at UW. 
The website will be a center for all the information a student would need in order to create a balanced schedule 
for their quarters; a collection of student opinions and experiences about specific CSE courses.

## Repository Layout
We are in our early stages of development. Our current repo layout is:

### `app`
The folder for all of our development files.
### `reports`
The folder for our weekly status reports.
